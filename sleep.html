      This page is meant to help you steady your breathing, thus lowering your anxiety and making it easier for you
      to fall asleep. If you are starting on this page, that means that you have already visited our "Calibrate" page,
      which gathers data on your current breathing. We then apply that breathing rate here to provide customized relaxation
      techniques just for you. <br><br> As you can see, you are given five options as to what soundtrack to play (none is also an option).
      Your next step is to click the play button. Notice how a circle will appear and begin to shrink and expand. It has
      been placed at exactly the speed made for you, based on information from the "Calibrate" page. Your job is to simply
      listen to the soundtrack of your choice while matching your breathing to this circle. Inhale as the circle expands
      and exhale as it shrinks. Feel free to pause and change the soundtrack at any time. <br><br>We hope this helps you leave your stress
      behind and focus solely on your breathing!
