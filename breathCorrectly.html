    <div class="grid-item"><p1>Try to take a deep breath in and exhale. If you are getting taller and smaller you are breathing incorrectly.
    In this video, Dr. Belisa Vranich explains  why this happens and how we can fix it. You breath incorrectly when you use your neck and shoulders
    to pick up your thoracic activity (between the neck and abdomonem) and this usually occurs for adults over the age of five. As we get older
    we tend to sit more and more at desks, averaging between 13 and 16 hours a day. Furthermore, as we pick up more injuries, sometimes through sports
    or just on accident, it becomes painful to breath through your entire body, and as a result we tend to only breath through our neck. This, in combination
    with waist tightening clothes severly limit our all round breathing. To breath correctly, in an anatomically congruous (whole body) manner,
    you have to breath with your whole body. When you inhale you have to inhale and open up your body, 360 degrees.
    To see an example of correct breathing techniques look at any other animal, rats, dogs, turtles, anyone. </p1></div>
    <div class="grid-item"><p1>Lucas Rockwood explores how, instead of reacting to situations,
    your nervous system, and specifically your breathing, can control its reactions. He mentions
    three different techniques which help you gain control over your nervous system- the water breathing,
    the whiskey breathing, and the coffee breathing. The water breathing is when you breath in for four counts
    and out again for four counts. This technique calms you and Rockwood recommends you do this practice whenever
    you feel stressed out. The whiskey technique is very similar to the water form but now you exhale for eight counts
    instead of four. This technique is especially effective in helping you fall asleep because it essentially slows your heart rate. The
    last technique is the coffee technique, which focuses solely on breathing out sharply, almost like a sneeze. This is very effective when you
    need to stay awake because it increases your heart rate. Through the constant practice of these three techniques, Lucas Rockwood believes that
    a person will be able to maintain a healthy breathing process which then improves both your mental and physical health.</p1></div>
