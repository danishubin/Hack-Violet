          <br>Welcome to DreamScape, the #1 website that helps you improve your breathing skills, relax a bit, and more! Before you jump into our product
          we would like to give you a brief overview of this wonderfully unique breathing app.

          <br><br>There are two important pages that you should know about.
          One of them being the relax page where, you will be able to calm down and release any anxiety you might have. A ball
          will expand and compress as you breath in and out, all while nice relaxing music and sounds are played. You can change the sounds by
          selecting and choosing them from the drop down menu. Furthermore, you can pause and play the music and the movement of the ball if you desire a break
          or something comes up.  Another important page teaches you how to breathe correctly. It applies Dr. Belisa Vranich's (from Business Insider)
          and Lucas Rockwood's (from Ted Talk) theories of why humans breath incorrectly and how we are able to fix it. We highly reccomend watching the videos,
          or at least read a quick description about what was talked about. These videos are not only eductional but also a joy to watch.

          <br><br> These two features are only improved by the Calibirate tool, where the user can easily and quickly personalize the speed of the music
          and expanison / compression of the ball. With just ten clicks, our web server will be able to store your average breath time and use it for any
          necessary operations. If you feel like anything went wrong, you can reenter your data so no need to stress out. After all, the purpose of this is
          to alleviate any stress.
          If you would like to calibrate go to the link <a href = "home.html">here</a> or select "Calibrate" from
          the above task bar.
          Without this you will not be able to fully enjoy the DreamScape experience.
          <br><br>Since many people, espacially
          during these Covid times, struggle from lung issues, we at DreamSCAPE want to improve everyones lives by helping them lower these issues.
