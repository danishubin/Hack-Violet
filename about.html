      DreamScape was founded in January 2021, a few months after Covid-19 started. During this hard time , we have observed people
      all over the world struggle to take care of themselves. That is why we set out to help people think about themselves.  A large
      component of this care is sleep, which improves both the mental and physical health of a person. For this reason, our aim is to
      provide each and every user with a fast, easy, and above all, relaxing way, to fall into a deep sleep and release all anxiety.
      <br><br>
      Our website measures how long the user's average breath is, creating a circle that shrinks and increases for that certain length of time.
      After applying it to the calming music and other sound effects the user is able to completly relax and calm down. More specifically, we provide
      them with many different calming sounds that will be expanded in the future. There is also a circle, which will be expanded to all shapese in the future,
      which grows and shrinks based on the speed  of the user's breathing. By customizing the features, we are able to avoid the constant problems other
      applications with similar features frequently encounter. For example, most other apps provide sound or a circle that is either too fast, so the user
      can't keep up, or too slow, so the user ends up holding their breath instead of breathing steadily. By using our product, we hope that you will not
      run into the same problems and instead will be so impressed that you would share it with your friends. Our goal is to reach every household in the world
      and provide our free service to help calm and relax people in moments of need.
      <br><br>Finally, we wish all our users the best of sleep!
      Good night and sleep tight!</p>
